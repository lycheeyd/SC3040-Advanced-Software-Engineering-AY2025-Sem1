# SC3040-Advanced-Software-Engineering

## Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Maven 3.6+
- Flutter SDK 3.0+
- HuggingFace Space (HF) [Docker Build]
- Git

## Architecture
- **Backend**: 5 Spring Boot microservices + 1 Spring Boot API Gateway (Hosted on HuggingFace)
- **Frontend**: Flutter Based Mobile & Web application
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server 2022 (Hosted on NTU's Virtual Machine behind a VPN)

## Backend Setup

### 1. HuggingFace Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: 
- All backend services are configured to use port 7860 as mandated by HuggingFace
- All service must await and respond to "/" Get request from HuggingFace to complete container startup
- HuggingFace adopts Readme.md file as configuration file for Space's metadata

### 2. HuggingFace Secrets
- Github fine grained PAT:  Read access to actions, code, and metadata

### 3. HuggingFace Variables (Dynamically injected)
- Github Repository
- Service Name
- Build_ID

### 3. HuggingFace Configuration Files
- Dockerfile (Same across all services)
- Readme.md (Unique per service)
- Build-Vars.env (Hold variables in #3, dynamically generated by CI/CD pipeline)

### 4. MicroService Naming Convention
This naming convention must be followed through for naming Service Folders in GitHub and creating Spaces on HuggingFace
- HF Staging Environment (UAT Branch): Calowin{SERVICENAME}
- HF Production Environment (Main Branch): Calowin{SERVICENAME}Live
- GitHub Folder: {SERVICENAME} (Placed in Root Directory)

- Horizontal Scale Out (Future): {EnvironmentName}-N (where N is integer with increment of 1)

## GitHub Deployment Setup

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Workflows
- Automatic Deployment: deploy-services-v3.yml
  - Triggered On pull-request completion into UAT branch and main branch
    
- Manual Deployment: manual-full-deploy-services.yml
  - Options available to deploy each services individually OR All
